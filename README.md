# pgres
Easy start/stop/status for a PostgreSQL server.

If you've got Postgres installed, stick pgres in your bin and type:
```bash
pgres start
```
to fire up the server! You can then use:
```bash
pgres stop
```
to shut it down. Additionally, you can check the status of the server (pid, etc) by using plain old:
```bash
pgres
```
